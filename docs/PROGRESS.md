- **Phase 5: Inbound Workflow (2025-12-27)**
  - Inbound mode (Put Away) logic and task generation.
  - Receiving Dock interaction and visual feedback.
  - Automatic mode switching (Pick-to-Ship -> Put Away -> Pick-to-Ship).

- **Phase 6: Simulation Complexity (2025-12-27)**
  - Slot quantity and item type attributes added to racks.
  - Randomized Picking/Inbound task generation based on rack stock.
